# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for NFL Trajectory Prediction

## 🎯 Goal
Reduce RMSE from **0.60 → 0.50-0.55** using physics-based constraints

## 📚 Theoretical Foundation

**Paper**: Raissi et al., "Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations" (arXiv:1803.10892)

**Key Idea**: Embed physical laws directly into the loss function, not just fit data

## 🔬 Our Implementation

### Baseline (0.60 RMSE)
Standard neural network trained only on data:
```
Loss = MSE(predicted_position, true_position)
```

### Physics-Informed (Expected: 0.53-0.56 RMSE)
Neural network trained on data + physics constraints:
```
Loss = Data_Loss + Kinematic_Loss + Acceleration_Loss + Smoothness_Loss
```

## 🧮 Physics Constraints

### 1. Kinematic Consistency (Weight: 0.1)
**Law**: Velocity = Δposition / Δtime

```python
v_predicted = (x[t+1] - x[t]) / 0.1
v_true = velocity[t]
kinematic_loss = ||v_predicted - v_true||²
```

**Why**: Ensures position predictions are consistent with velocity field

### 2. Acceleration Bounds (Weight: 0.05)
**Law**: Human acceleration limited to ~10 m/s² (NFL players ~8-10 m/s²)

```python
a = (v[t+1] - v[t]) / 0.1
a_violation = max(0, |a| - 10.0)
accel_loss = a_violation²
```

**Why**: Prevents physically impossible predictions (teleportation, super-speed)

### 3. Smoothness (Weight: 0.02)
**Law**: Jerk (rate of change of acceleration) should be minimized

```python
jerk = (a[t+1] - a[t]) / 0.1
smooth_loss = ||jerk||²
```

**Why**: Real trajectories are smooth, not jagged

### 4. Data Loss (Weight: 1.0)
**Standard**: Huber loss for robustness to outliers

```python
data_loss = SmoothL1Loss(predicted_position, true_position)
```

## 📊 Expected Impact

| Component | Weight | Expected Δ RMSE |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Baseline | - | 0.600 |
| + Kinematic | 0.1 | -0.02 to -0.03 |
| + Accel Bounds | 0.05 | -0.01 to -0.02 |
| + Smoothness | 0.02 | -0.01 to -0.02 |
| **Total** | - | **0.53-0.56** |

## 🎓 Why This Works

1. **Long Horizon Benefits**: Physics constraints most helpful for t+20, t+30 predictions where data alone struggles

2. **Generalization**: Physical laws transfer across plays, even unseen situations

3. **Regularization**: Physics acts as inductive bias, preventing overfitting

4. **Interpretability**: Model learns physically plausible motions

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Step 1: Baseline Verification
Run current notebook (0.60 LB) to confirm starting point

### Step 2: Add Physics Loss
Run with Physics-Informed loss (our current implementation)

### Step 3: Tune Weights
If RMSE improves, tune weights:
- Kinematic: 0.05 to 0.20
- Accel: 0.02 to 0.10
- Smooth: 0.01 to 0.05

### Step 4: Combine with Other Improvements
If physics helps, add:
- SWA (Stochastic Weight Averaging)
- Larger model capacity
- Better data augmentation

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Files Modified
- `final_submission.ipynb`: Replaced `EnhancedTemporalLoss` with `PhysicsInformedLoss`

### Key Parameters
```python
kinematic_weight = 0.1   # Velocity-position consistency
accel_weight = 0.05      # Acceleration bounds
smooth_weight = 0.02     # Jerk minimization
MAX_ACCEL = 10.0         # m/s² (NFL player limit)
dt = 0.1                 # seconds (frame rate)
```

### Computational Cost
**No additional cost!** Physics terms computed from same predictions, no extra forward passes.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Upload to Kaggle** and run (~ 30-45 minutes)
2. **Check Public LB** - Expected: 0.53-0.56
3. **If < 0.56**: ✓ Great! Tune weights, try combinations
4. **If 0.56-0.58**: ✓ Good! Combine with SWA or capacity increase
5. **If > 0.58**: ✗ Physics not helping, try different approach
